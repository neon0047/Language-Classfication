# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes uses a similar method to predict the probability of different class based on various attributes. This algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes.

# Key Concepts

1.Explore and visualize dataset to identify key issues in training data

2.Preprocess and clean dataset using relevant methods

3.Explore theory of Naive Bayes Modeling, and train first model

4.Developing approach using learned theory to improve performance

5.Designing new approach using subwords to mitigate class imbalance problems
